                    We use the information we collect in the following ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Account Authentication and Profile Management:</b>Your email, name, birthdate, blood group, weight, and height are stored using Firebase Authentication and Firestore to securely manage your account.</li>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>3. Sharing Your Information</h3>
